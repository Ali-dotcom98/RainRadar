## 🧠 Machine Learning Components

### 🧩 Classification
- Predicts weather conditions such as *sunny*, *rainy*, or *cloudy* using:
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
  - **Naive Bayes**
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
  - **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**

### 🔗 Association Rule Mining
- Discovers relationships between variables using:
  - **Apriori Algorithm**
  - **FP-Growth Algorithm**
- Example: *“High humidity and low pressure often indicate rainfall.”*

### 🎯 Clustering
- Groups similar weather trends using:
  - **K-Means Clustering**
  - **Hierarchical Clustering**
- Helps identify regional or seasonal weather patterns.
